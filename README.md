# [WIP] betterty
This is a transpiler that converts TypeScript to Rust for true static typing. The goal is to make the converted code easy to port, even if it doesn't work perfectly.
This tool is intended for [octaltree/playwright-rust](https://github.com/octaltree/playwright-rust) and may not be suitable for general use.
